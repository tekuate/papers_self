1, Data are uwnd.1999.nc,vwnd.1999.nc and hgt.1999.nc. They are daily data downloaded from NCEP/NCAR website, four times daily, 00z,06z,12z,18z.


2, There are two gs files: span1.gs and span2.gs, which can plot two files span1.gmf and span2.gmf (Aug09-Aug13 and Sep01-Sep05).

Following are the steps to use Grads to do some plots:

a: Type the command (gradsnc) first under the current directory.
gradsnc

b: type 
yes

c: type
run span1.gs
run span2.gs

d: type
quit


3, Then two files span1.gmf and span2.gmf will be produced.


4, run convert.sh to convert these two gmf files to ps files.(./convert.sh)


5, gv span1.ps and gv span2.ps to check the plots.


6, To do some changes with the plots, go to span1.gs and span2.gs files and edit where you want, and then follow from Step 2 again.


7, Two useful links to understand commands and functions in Grads:
