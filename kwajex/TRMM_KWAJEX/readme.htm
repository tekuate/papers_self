<BODY><PRE>TRMM KWAJEX Budget Analysis from 06:00 GM 7/24/1999 to 12:00 GMT 9/14/1999

Version 0 ---- 7/6/2002

The two fortran programs read the two ascii data files for single-level and
multi-level fields respectively.  The netcdf file contains all the data.  The 
files are self-explanatory.

This is a preliminary release.  Future revision is anticated as better estimates of surface rainfall and latent and sensible heat fluxes become available.

Special thanks to:

 Courtney Schumacher at the Univ. of Washington and
 Paul Ciesielski at the Colorado State University
 for their active participation in the project.


This version of the variational budget analysis has used the 
following data sources:

 1. TRMM KWAJEX field campaign soundings quality controlled by Sandra Yuter 
    at UW and additional sounding data from Dev Roy and Jeff Halverson at GSFC,
    operational sounding data prepared by Paul Ciesielski at CSU. 

 2. Surface meteorological variables and radiative fluxes 
    prepared by Courtney Schumacher and Jose Fuentes at U. Virginia.

 3. ISCCP TOA and surface radiative fluxes and cloud information from
    Bill Rossow's group at GISS

 4. Surface precipitation from radar and raingauges 
    supplied by Courtney Schumacher at UW, and TRMM rainfall from the 
    GSFC DAAC.

 5. NCEP analysis of upper air fields and surface latent and sensible heat 
   fluxes prepared by Paul Ciesielski at CSU


 These data sources have been used to obtain the best estimates of 
 area-averaged variables for the analysis domain.  They are then
 subjected to the constrained variational analysis of Zhang et al. 
 (MWR, 2001). 


Description of data sources for each variable in the released data:
 
6-hourly time series of single-level fields:

1.	surface precipitation

Radar rainfall of every three hours at 2 km x 2 km resolution from UW is averaged in the 
budget domain (see web http://atmgcm.msrc.sunysb.edu/trmm/trmmkwjx/mainkwjx.html) and 
to six hour bins to form one time series.  Hourly rain gauge measurements from Carlos, 
Gagan, Kwajalein, and Roi are averaged to six hours to form another time series.  The 
TRMM combined precipitation product of 2B31 is used to fill some six-hour bins (for a total of 
27 six-hour bins).  These three data sources are then equally weighted to form an averaged 
rainfall estimate.  For time bins when no measurements are available (only one six-hour bin), 
the adjusted NCEP rainfall in the budget domain is used, with the adjustment from using the 
regression of the analysis rainfall against the available data.

2.	surface latent heat flux

This is from the NCEP analysis of latent heat flux, as judged between the consistency of 
NCEP surface winds and the surface mini-tower wind measurements during the IOP at the 
Meck Island from the University of Virginia, as well as the consistency of the surface winds 
and the latent heat flux.

3.	surface sensible heat flux

Same as above

4.	surface pressure

Equally weighted between the Meck Island observation and the balloon sounding stations.  
Time bins with no data (for a total of 3 six-hour bins) are filled with adjusted NCEP analysis 
based on regression against available data.

5.	surface air temperature

Same as above

6.	surface wind speed

Same as above

7. surface u wind

Same as above

8. surface v wind

Same as above

9. surface net downward radiation

Average of domain averaged ISCCP radiation fluxes (two closest ISCCP grids) and surface 
mini-tower measurements at Meck Island all averaged to six hours

10. surface upward shortwave radiation

Same as above

11. surface downward shortwave radiation

Same as above

12. surface upward longwave radiation

Same as above

13. surface downward longwave radiation

Same as above

14. TOA upward shortwave radiation

ISCCP averaged

15. TOA downward shortwave radiation

ISCCP averaged

16. TOA upward longwave radiation

ISCCP averaged

17. ISCCP clound amount

18. Time derivative of column precipitable water

From the analyzed sounding data.  Note that vertical integration uses the analyzed surface 
pressure and the 100 mb as the top pressure of the integration.

19. Column integrated horizontal transport of water vapor

From the variational analysis.  Note that vertical integration uses the analyzed surface 
pressure and the 100 mb as the top pressure of the integration.

20. Surface evaporation

See surface latent heat flux.  This variable is provided here to check the column moisture 
budget in the unit of (mm/hour)

21. Time derivative of dry static energy

Same as above

22. Column integrated horizontal transport of dry static energy.  Note that vertical integration 
uses the analyzed surface pressure and the 100 mb as the top pressure of the integration.
 
Same as above

23. Column integrated radiative heating

Derived from the above surface and TOA radiative fluxes

23. Column integrated latent heating

Derived from surface precipitation.  This variable is provided here to check the column energy 
budget

6-hourly time-pressure cross sections of multi-level fields:

All analyzed from the constrained variational analysis method of Zhang et al. (MWR 2001).  
Input data are 9 sounding stations, with five of them quality-controlled by Sandra Yuter at UW 
(brown, lae, roi, kwaj, wotja), one from Dev Roy at GSFC (Meck), and three from operational 
soundings from Paul Ciesielsky at CSU (upa_91348, upa_91366,and upa_91376).  The 
NCEP upper air analysis has been used as a background and initial guess.
